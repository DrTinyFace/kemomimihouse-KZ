  <hana.label>Rabbit-eared hana</hana.label>
  <hana.description>Powerful but clumsy creatures, the rabbit-eared hanas are a rare species on the rimworlds. They seem to cohabitate well with the fox-eared kon and the wolf-eared siro, but tend to act aloof and sometimes slightly hostile towards others. They will act similarly to communities that take them in.
  
  The rabbit-eared hana seem to have their own trade caravans roaming the rimworlds. Communities that take them in will occasionally wake up to extra silver or a strange flowery-smelling liquid in their storage. This liquid is known to be safe for consumption and is even known to make the consumer look a bit younger and talk a bit sweeter, even if it's only temporary.</hana.description>

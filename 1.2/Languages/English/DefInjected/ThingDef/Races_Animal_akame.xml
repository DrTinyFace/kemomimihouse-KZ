  <akame.description>Ram-horned akames are the timid sister species of the ram-horned aone.
  
Ram-horned akames are known to carry a small stuffed bear-like spirit they call Kumagon. They will throw the bear at any potential attackers, causing the spirit to violently strike the threat.</akame.description>

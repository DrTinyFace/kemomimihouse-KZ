  <siro.description>The wolf-eared siros have recently been moved to the rimworlds in an attempt to save their species after their habitats were burned down on their original glitterworld. They are incredibly cautious creatures, preferring isolation and solitude over being around others.
  
They are, however, incredibly powerful and loyal allies if you can get them to trust you.</siro.description>

  <yuki.description>The frost-dragon yukis were once true dragons that brutalized the unlucky rimworlds they lived on. Legend has it that the cat-eared mikos struck down the dragons and forced them to seal their powers away in a humanoid form.
  
While the yukis initially resented the mikos for locking their true forms in such a frail body, they eventually grew to tolerate and in some cases even enjoy the simple things in life. Since their raw strength is locked within their humanoid bodies they instead choose to use ESP, especially ice magic. Despite this, they still have short claws they can defend themselves with if needed.</yuki.description>

  <aome.description>Ram-horned aomes are the sister species of the ram-horned akames. Unlike the akames, aomes are bold both in defending themselves and their sister species.
  
Similar to the ram-horned akames, the ram-horned aomes have a small guardian spirit that they wield in battle. Their Kumagoro will come to their defense any time they're attacked or angered.</aome.description>

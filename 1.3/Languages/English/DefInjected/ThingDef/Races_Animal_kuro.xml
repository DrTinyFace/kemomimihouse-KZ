  <kuro.description>The dog-eared kuros are a friendly species often found alongside the wolf-eared siros. They enjoy collecting herbs for their black teas, which are known for being able to prevent toxic buildups within the body.
  
While they are generally friendly creatures, a botched taming attempt or an attack will bring out their violent side.</kuro.description>

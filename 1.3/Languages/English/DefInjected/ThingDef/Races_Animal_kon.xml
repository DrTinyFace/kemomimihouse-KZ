  <kon.label>Fox-eared kon</kon.label>
  <kon.description>While powerful, fox-eared kons are incredibly kind and compassionate. They're known for collecting rare herbs to turn into powerful healing potions that can be poured on wounds to cure all but the worst of wounds.
  
You should never let their temperament fool you however: when harmed, fox-eared kons will strike quickly and lethally with their wakizashi, a long thin bladed weapon they carry on their backs at all times.</kon.description>
